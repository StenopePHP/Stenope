# Stenope

> The static website generation tool for Symfony.

![CLI](cli.png)

## Why another static site generator?

We're Symfony developers that couldn't find a static website generator that bended to our needs.

We needed a way of generating static websites that:

- Doesn't impose a format, a structure or a location for the data.
- Runs in a [Symfony](symfony.com) environment.
- Allow us to develop virtually any feature we might need.

Stenope does that.

## Installation

In your existing Symfony app:

```shell
composer require stenope/stenope
```

If you plan to create a new app from scratch, you can give a try to the [Stenope Skeleton](https://stenopephp.github.io/skeleton/).

## Usage

````shell
bin/console -e prod cache:clear
bin/console -e prod stenope:build ./static
````

Your Symfony app is now a static website in: `./static`! ‚ú®

**Next:** [learn more about Stenope's content management system](doc/loading-content.md).

## Philosophy and goals

Stenope was designed with these goals in mind:

- Stenope meets your needs, not the other way around.
- Stenope runs in any Symfony project out of the box, connects with standard Symfony components and feels natural to Symfony developers.
- Stenope is highly extensible: features can be replaced, added or removed.

## How it works

- üîç Stenope scans your Symfony app (like a search engine crawler would) and dumps every page into a static HTML file.
- üõ† Stenope provides tools for loading and parsing various data sources (like local Markdown files or distant headless CMS).
- üñå Stenope enriches the parsed data by applying a series of processors (like Syntax Highlighting, slug generation, etc.).
- üß≤ Stenope finally hydrates your custom PHP objects with the enriched data and provides interfaces for listing and retrieving them (like an ORM would).
- ‚öôÔ∏è Stenope gives you a lot of control over the whole process by providing entrypoints, interfaces and default implementations that are entirely replaceable.

## What Stenope is not

Stenope is not a ready-to-use bloging system: but you could quickly _write your own_ blog system with it!
